			<p><b>•</b> Know your evacuation route. Keep gas in your car.</p>
			<p><b>If a Volcano Erupts in Your Area</b></p>
			<p><b>•</b> Evacuate only as recommended by authorities to stay clear of lava,

			<p><b>•</b> Avoid river areas and low-lying regions.</p>
			<p><b>•</b> Before you leave the house, change into long-sleeved shirts and 
			long pants and use goggles or eyeglasses, not contacts. Wear an emergency mask 
			or hold a damp cloth over your face.</p>
			<p><b>•</b> If you are not evacuating, close windows and doors and block 
			chimneys and other vents, to prevent ash from coming into the house.</p>
			<p><b>•</b> Be aware that ash may put excess weight on your roof and need to be swept away. Wear protection during cleanups.</p>
			<p><b>•</b> Ash can damage engines and metal parts, so avoid driving. If you must drive, stay below 35 miles (56 kilometers) an hour.

      <p>Not all earthquakes cause tsunami but if you feel a strong earthquake or a long one you should move to higher ground</p>
           
			<p><b>STOP, DROP, HOLD & COVER</b></p>
			<p><b>Survival Tips</b></p>
		<p><b>1.</b> Get away from glass, large furniture, and other hazards, <br>
		if possible.<br> 
		<b>•</b> In the first few seconds after the shaking starts, <br>try to quickly move 
		away from anything<br> that could fall and injure you.</p>

		<p><b>2.</b> Drop to your hands and knees under a sturdy table or desk.<br>
		<b>•</b> Look for a sturdy piece of furniture, such as a solid table, <br>
		that can offer cover from falling objects. Get down on your<br> 
		hands and knees, and crouch under the desk or table<br>
		until the shaking stops.</p>

		<p><b>3.</b> Protect your head and neck from falling debris.<br>
		<b>•</b> If possible, grab a pillow, sofa cushion, or another	object to <br> 
		shield your face and head. If there’s nothing nearby to use<br> 
		as a shield, cover your face, head, and neck <br>with your hands and arms.</p>

		<p><b>4.</b> Remain in your safe spot until the shaking stops.<br>
		<b>•</b> Stay put until the shaking has stopped for 1 or 2 minutes.<br>
		Remain on guard when you get up, as aftershocks<br> 
		can occur at any time after an earthquake.</p>

			<p>Build steal or floor house in low lying areas<br>
				- During the design  of the house  and garden look to include drainage system<br>
				- Look to include water catchment systems<br>
				- If your house is prone to flooding think about rebuilding to higher ground<br>

				<b>1.</b> Avoid areas subject to sudden flooding.<br>

      <p><b>Way to protect your house and family from landslide:</b></p>
           
			<p>- Know the history of the area before building house and gardens<br>
				- Don’t cut down too much trees in sloppy areas or hill<br>
				- Plant some trees in landslide prone areas to hold the ground together<br>
				- Don’t build house at the bottom of the hill or cliff<br>
				- If you live in a landslide prone area identify safe place</p>
				
			<p><b>During a severe storm, stay alert and awake. Many deaths <br>
			from landslides occur while people are sleeping.<p></b>
			
			<b>1.</b> Listen to local news stations on a battery-powered<br>
			 radio for warnings of heavy rainfall.<br>
			<b>2.</b> Listen for unusual sounds that might indicate moving debris, <br>
			such as trees cracking or boulders knocking together.<br>
			<b>3.</b> Move away from the path of a landslide or debris flow as quickly<br>
			 as possible. The danger from a mudflow increases near stream<br> 
			channels and with prolonged heavy rains. Mudflows can move <br>
			faster than you can walk or run. Look upstream before crossing <br>
			a bridge and do not cross the bridge if a mudflow is approaching.<br>
			<b>4.</b> Avoid river valleys and low-lying areas.<br>
			<b>5.</b> If you are near a stream or channel, be alert for any sudden increase or decrease in water flow and notice whether the water changes from clear to muddy. Such changes may mean there is debris flow activity upstream so be prepared to move quickly.
			Curl into a tight ball and protect your head if escape is not possible.
